## v0.3.5 ‚Äì Critical Stability Release (September 2025)

### Drag-and-Drop Stability Fixes
- **Fixed "cannot find draggable" errors**: Added required `style={provided.draggableProps.style}` binding to Card.jsx
- **Prevented mid-drag re-renders**: Implemented dragging state with SWR pause during drag operations
- **Fixed animation conflicts**: Gated hover animations when `snapshot.isDragging` to prevent transform conflicts
- **Clean drag lifecycle**: Added `onDragStart` and `finally` block in `handleDragEnd` to ensure state cleanup

### Conversational AI Improvements

- **Idempotency**: Implemented `requestId` to prevent duplicate operations
- **Conflict resolution**: 409 conflicts trigger automatic board resync with toast notifications
- **Operations covered**: move_card, update_card, delete_card, create_card, bulk operations, column operations

### Error Handling Enhancements
- **Consistent error envelopes**: All routes wrapped with `withErrorHandling` utility
- **Standardized format**: `{ error: string, details?: any }` structure across all endpoints
- **Move-card hardening**: Added error wrapper to align with other endpoints

### CSRF Documentation
- **Added clarifying notes**: Documented that CSRF is disabled at route level due to Edge runtime limitations
- **Future-ready**: Kept implementation as reference for future per-route header checks

### MCP Server Integrations
- **GitHub MCP**: Connected for natural language git operations
- **Filesystem MCP**: Browse project files with context awareness
- **Memory MCP**: Persistent state storage between sessions

- **MCP test suite**: Comprehensive testing of all connected MCP servers
- **Live validation**: Tests confirm all fixes working in production
