# WordFlux Constitution

## Core Principles
1. **Security First**: All features must implement proper authentication and encryption
2. **User Privacy**: No user data should be exposed without explicit consent
3. **Performance**: Features should not degrade application performance below acceptable thresholds
4. **Accessibility**: All UI components must be accessible to users with disabilities
5. **Maintainability**: Code must be well-documented and follow established patterns

## Technical Standards
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure token storage
- **Encryption**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3+ for all communications
- **API Design**: RESTful with proper error handling
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must be documented

## Security Requirements
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Authentication required for all data-modifying operations
- Rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets in code

## Development Process
- Feature specifications required before implementation
- Code review required for all changes
- Automated testing before deployment
- Staging environment validation
- Production deployment with rollback capability
