# Feature Specification: Enterprise Dashboard Development

**Feature Branch**: `003-enterprise-dashboard-development`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enterprise Dashboard Development - Transform the dashboard into a fully functional enterprise-level project management system with real Kanban boards, time tracking, analytics, team collaboration, and organization management features for marketing studios and professional teams"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (marketing studios, professional teams), actions (manage projects, track time, collaborate), data (boards, cards, time entries, analytics), constraints (enterprise-level, real-time)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager at a marketing studio, I need to manage multiple client projects simultaneously, track team member time on tasks, and generate reports for clients showing project progress and resource utilization. The system should provide a visual Kanban board where I can drag tasks between columns, assign team members, set deadlines, and monitor overall project health through analytics dashboards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project manager with 5 active projects, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they see all projects as separate boards with current task status
2. **Given** a team member working on a task, **When** they start the timer, **Then** time tracking begins and is recorded against that task
3. **Given** a project with overdue tasks, **When** viewing the board, **Then** overdue items are visually highlighted with red indicators
4. **Given** multiple team members on a project, **When** one moves a card, **Then** other users see the change in real-time
5. **Given** a completed sprint, **When** generating reports, **Then** time tracking, velocity, and completion metrics are accurately calculated
6. **Given** a new team member joins, **When** invited by admin, **Then** they receive email invitation and can access assigned projects

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of concurrent users not specified]?
- How does system handle conflicting simultaneous card moves by different users?
- What occurs when a user's permission is revoked while they're actively using the system?
- How are orphaned tasks handled when a column is deleted?
- What happens to time tracking entries if a task is deleted?
- How does the system behave when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data storage limits not specified]?

1. **Scale & Performance**: Maximum number of concurrent users, organizations, and data storage limits
2. **File Management**: Maximum file size for attachments and total storage per organization
3. **Export Formats**: Which formats should reports support (PDF, CSV, Excel, others)?
4. **Data Retention**: How long should deleted items be retained? Archive policy?
5. **Notifications**: Which channels (email, in-app, push, SMS)?
6. **Integrations**: Which third-party services to integrate (Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar, etc.)?
