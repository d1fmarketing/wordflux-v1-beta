# MCP Servers Installed for WordFlux

You're right - Slack is useless for this project! Here's what's actually useful:

## ✅ Connected & Useful MCP Servers

### 1. **GitHub MCP** ✅
**Why useful for WordFlux:**
- Manage commits without CLI
- Create PRs with natural language
- Track issues for bugs
- Version control operations
```
Example: "Create a PR for the concurrency fixes"
Instead of: git add, git commit, git push, gh pr create...
```

### 2. **Filesystem MCP** ✅
**Why useful for WordFlux:**
- Browse project files naturally
- Search across codebase
- Read/write files with context
```
Example: "Show me all API routes in WordFlux"
Instead of: find . -name "*.js" | grep api | xargs ls...
```

### 3. **Memory MCP** ✅
**Why useful for WordFlux:**
- Store testing state between sessions
- Remember board configurations
- Track development progress
```
Example: "Remember this board state for testing"
Instead of: Manual JSON exports and storage
```

### 4. **Playwright MCP** ✅
**Why useful for WordFlux:**
- Test drag-and-drop without scripts
- Automate UI testing
- Screenshot board states
- Test GPT-5 controller
```
Example: "Test dragging cards between columns"
Instead of: Writing 100+ lines of Playwright test code
```

## ❌ Removed (Not Useful)

- **Slack**: Unless you want Slack notifications for board updates
- **Brave Search**: WebSearch already built-in
- **Fetch**: WebFetch already built-in

## ⏳ Pending Configuration

- **Linear**: Needs workspace URL (for project management)
- **Sentry**: Needs project URL (for error tracking in production)

## The Real Power

With these 4 MCP servers, you can:
1. **Test WordFlux**: "Use Playwright to test the board"
2. **Manage Code**: "Commit the concurrency fixes"
3. **Browse Files**: "Show me all board-related components"
4. **Remember State**: "Store this test configuration"

All through natural language instead of CLI commands!
