**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix GPT-5 chat interface and dashboard timeline rendering issues"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified: chat interface missing, timeline rendering broken
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: users wanting GPT-5 chat
   ’ Actions: chat with AI, view dashboard timeline
   ’ Data: chat messages, timeline events
   ’ Constraints: GPT-5 model access required
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ GPT-5 model variant not specified (Pro vs Mini)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow: access chat, send messages, view responses
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (chat messages, timeline data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN: Model variant needs clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a WordFlux user, I want to access the GPT-5 chat interface to interact with AI for task management assistance, and view my project timeline on the dashboard without rendering issues so I can track progress visually.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user is on the application home page, **When** they navigate to chat, **Then** GPT-5 chat interface loads without errors
2. **Given** user types a message in chat, **When** they send it, **Then** they receive a response from GPT-5 within 5 seconds
3. **Given** user is on the dashboard, **When** they view the timeline, **Then** calendar displays correctly with one weekday header row and date numbers in cells
4. **Given** user has tasks in the system, **When** viewing timeline, **Then** tasks appear on their scheduled dates without text overflow

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPT-5 API is unavailable? System should show clear error message and retry option
- How does system handle timeline with no tasks? Should display empty calendar grid with proper structure
- What if user sends empty chat message? System should prevent submission or show validation message

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide access to GPT-5 chat interface from main navigation
- **FR-002**: Chat interface MUST accept text input and display AI responses
- **FR-003**: System MUST use GPT-5 Pro model for chat responses
- **FR-004**: Dashboard timeline MUST render weekday labels only once as header row
- **FR-005**: Timeline calendar cells MUST display only date numbers and associated task indicators
- **FR-006**: Chat interface MUST maintain conversation history during session
- **FR-007**: Timeline MUST not show duplicated or overlapping text elements
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle chat errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-009**: Timeline MUST be scrollable and responsive to screen size
- **FR-010**: Chat responses MUST be formatted with proper markdown rendering

### Key Entities
- **Chat Message**: Represents user input or AI response with timestamp, role (user/assistant), and content
- **Timeline Event**: Represents a task or milestone displayed on calendar with date, title, and status
- **Calendar Cell**: Visual container showing date number and associated events for that day
