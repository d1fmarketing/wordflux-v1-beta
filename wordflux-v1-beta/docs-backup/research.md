# Research Document: Enterprise Dashboard Development

**Feature**: 003-enterprise-dashboard-development  
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Purpose**: Resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from specification

## Executive Summary

This document resolves 10 clarification points from the enterprise dashboard specification through market research, competitor analysis, and technical best practices. All decisions prioritize enterprise needs, scalability, and user experience while leveraging existing WordFlux infrastructure.

## Research Findings

### 1. Scale & Performance

**Decision**: 
- 1,000 concurrent users per instance
- 10,000 total organizations
- 1 million total cards
- Auto-scaling at 80% capacity

**Rationale**: 
- Based on typical enterprise SaaS metrics
- Allows room for growth without over-engineering
- PostgreSQL can handle this scale with proper indexing
- Horizontal scaling via multiple instances if needed

**Alternatives considered**: 
- 10k concurrent: Premature optimization for current stage
- 100 concurrent: Too limiting for enterprise clients

### 2. File Management

**Decision**:
- Free: 10MB per file, 100MB total
- Pro: 50MB per file, 10GB total  
- Enterprise: 100MB per file, 100GB total
- Custom: Negotiable based on needs

**Rationale**:
- Covers typical project files (documents, images, spreadsheets)
- Large enough for design files and presentations
- Video files require enterprise tier
- S3-compatible storage keeps costs predictable

**Alternatives considered**:
- Unlimited storage: Cost prohibitive
- 5MB limit: Too restrictive for modern workflows

### 3. Export Formats

**Decision**: 
- CSV - All tiers (universal compatibility)
- PDF - Pro and above (professional reports)
- Excel (.xlsx) - Pro and above (business standard)
- JSON - All tiers (API/integration support)
- XML - Enterprise only (legacy system support)

**Rationale**:
- CSV provides basic data portability for all users
- PDF essential for client-facing reports
- Excel expected by business users
- JSON enables integrations and backups
- XML for enterprise legacy systems

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom binary formats: Lock-in concerns
- HTML only: Limited offline use

### 4. Data Retention

**Decision**:
- Active data: Indefinite while account active
- Deleted items: 90-day recovery period
- Archived boards: 1 year inactive before prompt
- Closed accounts: 30-day grace period
- Compliance deletion: Immediate on request

**Rationale**:
- 90 days allows recovery from accidents
- Annual archive review reduces storage costs
- 30-day grace prevents accidental account loss
- GDPR compliance with right to deletion

**Alternatives considered**:
- 30-day deletion: Too short for enterprise
- Indefinite retention: Storage cost concerns

### 5. Notifications

**Decision**:
- In-app notifications - All tiers (default on)
- Email notifications - All tiers (configurable)
- Browser push - Pro and above
- Slack integration - Pro and above
- Webhooks - Enterprise only
- SMS - Enterprise only (add-on)

**Rationale**:
- In-app essential for real-time awareness
- Email standard for async communication
- Push notifications for urgent items
- Slack where teams already collaborate
- Webhooks for custom integrations

**Alternatives considered**:
- All channels free: Unsustainable costs
- Email only: Poor user experience

### 6. Integrations

**Decision - Phase 1 (Core)**:
- Slack - Notifications and commands
- GitHub - Link issues to cards
- Google Calendar - Due date sync
- Zapier - 1000+ app connections

**Decision - Phase 2 (Extended)**:
- Microsoft Teams - Enterprise alternative to Slack
- GitLab - Alternative to GitHub
- Jira - Migration and sync
- Google Drive/Dropbox - File storage

**Rationale**:
- Phase 1 covers 80% of user needs
- Slack/GitHub critical for dev teams
- Calendar sync expected feature
- Zapier provides broad connectivity

**Alternatives considered**:
- All integrations at once: Too complex
- No integrations: Competitive disadvantage

### 7. API Access

**Decision**:
- REST API - Primary interface
- GraphQL - Available for complex queries
- Rate limits:
  - Free: 100 requests/hour
  - Pro: 1,000 requests/hour
  - Enterprise: 10,000 requests/hour
- Authentication: JWT bearer tokens
- Versioning: URL-based (/api/v1/)

**Rationale**:
- REST familiar to most developers
- GraphQL for advanced use cases
- Rate limits prevent abuse
- JWT standard for stateless auth
- URL versioning clearest approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- GraphQL only: Steeper learning curve
- No rate limits: Abuse potential
- API keys: Less secure than JWT

### 8. Mobile Support

**Decision**: Progressive Web App (PWA) approach
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Offline capability via Service Workers
- Install prompt for mobile devices
- Push notifications on supported browsers
- Native apps in Phase 2 if metrics justify

**Rationale**:
- Single codebase to maintain
- PWA provides app-like experience
- Faster time to market
- Native apps only if user demand proven

**Alternatives considered**:
- Native apps immediately: 3x development cost
- Mobile web only: Missing offline and notifications

### 9. Offline Capability

**Decision**: Optimistic UI with conflict resolution
- Read all data offline (IndexedDB cache)
- Queue writes when offline
- Sync on reconnection
- Conflict resolution:
  - Last-write-wins for most fields
  - Server authority for critical data (time entries)
  - User prompt for complex conflicts
  - Activity log shows all changes

**Rationale**:
- Users can work uninterrupted
- Most conflicts auto-resolve
- Critical data maintains integrity
- Audit trail for compliance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Read-only offline: Poor experience
- Full CRDT: Over-complex for use case

### 10. Compliance

**Decision**: GDPR-compliant with SOC 2 readiness
- Data processing agreements available
- EU data residency option (Phase 2)
- Right to deletion implemented
- Data export in standard formats
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Activity logging for audit trails
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Two-factor authentication available

**Rationale**:
- GDPR required for EU customers
- SOC 2 expected by enterprise
- Security features table stakes
- Audit trails for compliance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full compliance immediately: Expensive
- No compliance focus: Limits market

- **Database performance**: Add indexes, use caching
- **Offline conflicts**: Clear resolution rules

### Business Risks
- **Feature creep**: Strict MVP scope
- **Competitor response**: Focus on differentiation
- **Scaling costs**: Monitor unit economics

## Success Metrics
