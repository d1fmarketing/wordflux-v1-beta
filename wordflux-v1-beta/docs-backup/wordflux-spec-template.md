# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**WordFlux Version**: v0.4.0-minimal
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: components, routes, data flows, UI elements
3. Check minimal mode compatibility
   ‚Üí If requires complex state: WARN "Consider Planka integration"
4. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
5. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Consider mobile and desktop views
6. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each must be testable via Playwright
7. Identify Components/Routes needed
8. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If violates minimal mode: ERROR "Too complex for current architecture"
9. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚úÖ Consider minimal mode architecture (leverage Planka/OpenAI)
- ‚ùå Avoid implementation details (no specific hooks, state management)
- üë• Written for product stakeholders, not developers

### WordFlux-Specific Considerations
- **Minimal Mode First**: Can this leverage Planka or existing services?
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity only if needed
- **Mobile-First**: All features must work on mobile devices
- **API Consistency**: Follow existing success/error patterns

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey, considering both chat and board interactions]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [user on desktop], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [user on mobile], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
3. **Given** [Planka board visible], **When** [chat interaction], **Then** [board update]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OpenAI API is down?
- How does system handle Planka iframe loading issues?
- What if user has no internet connectivity?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [capability that works in minimal mode]
- **FR-002**: Feature MUST [work with existing Planka embed]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [interaction via chat panel]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [maintain responsive layout]
- **FR-005**: Feature MUST [provide health check endpoint if API]

### UI/UX Requirements *(WordFlux specific)*
- **UX-001**: Component MUST use Tailwind CSS classes only
- **UX-002**: Feature MUST maintain 50/50 board/chat split on desktop
- **UX-003**: Mobile view MUST stack components vertically
- **UX-004**: Loading states MUST show toast notifications

### Integration Points *(if applicable)*
- **Chat Integration**: How does this interact with GPT-5?
- **Board Integration**: Does this need Planka API access?
- **Environment Variables**: What configuration is needed?
