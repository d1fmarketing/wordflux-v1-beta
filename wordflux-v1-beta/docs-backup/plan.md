# Implementation Plan: Enterprise Dashboard Development

**Branch**: `003-enterprise-dashboard-development` | **Date**: 2025-09-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/features/003-enterprise-dashboard-development/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Successfully loaded enterprise dashboard specification
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detected Project Type: web (Next.js existing app)
   → Set Structure Decision: Option 1 (Enhance existing structure)
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Single project, using existing framework directly
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Resolving 10 NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from spec
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Ensure minimal mode principles maintained
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Transform the existing WordFlux dashboard from 30% functionality to a fully-featured enterprise-level project management system. The dashboard currently has basic layout and chat functionality but lacks working boards, real-time collaboration, time tracking, and analytics. We'll leverage the existing PostgreSQL database schema (already comprehensive with 15+ entities), integrate proven components from wordflux-v3, and build upon the existing authentication system.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript with Next.js 14.2.32 (existing)
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18.3, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, OpenAI GPT-4 (existing)
**New Dependencies**: @dnd-kit/sortable, Socket.io, Redis, Chart.js, React Query/SWR
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (existing, fully configured), Redis (caching), S3-compatible (files)
**Testing**: Jest (existing), Playwright (E2E)
**Target Platform**: Web (responsive), Progressive Web App ready
**Project Type**: web - single Next.js app with integrated backend
**Performance Goals**: <200ms board operations, <500ms real-time sync, 60fps drag animations
**Constraints**: Use existing auth system, maintain current database schema
**Scale/Scope**: 1000 concurrent users, 10k organizations, 100k cards

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Enhance existing Next.js app structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Identified
1. **Scale & Performance**: Define concurrent user limits and optimization strategies
2. **File Management**: Storage limits and CDN integration
3. **Export Formats**: Standard formats for reports and data
4. **Data Retention**: Archive and deletion policies
5. **Notifications**: Channel preferences and delivery methods
6. **Integrations**: Third-party service connections
7. **API Access**: Rate limiting and authentication
8. **Mobile Support**: PWA vs native app decision
9. **Offline Capability**: Sync conflict resolution strategies
10. **Compliance**: GDPR and data privacy requirements

### Research Execution
Creating comprehensive research document to resolve all clarifications...

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Generation
Using existing Prisma schema entities:
- User, Organization, Board, Column, Card (existing)
- TimeEntry, CardAssignment, CardWatcher (existing)
- Comment, Attachment, Activity (existing)
- Subscription, Notification, Permission (existing)
- RefreshToken, BoardMember (existing)

### API Contract Generation
Creating OpenAPI specifications for:
- Board operations (list, create, update, delete, archive)
- Card management (CRUD, move, assign, watch)
- Column operations (create, reorder, update limits)
- Time tracking (start, stop, manual entry, reports)
- Analytics (metrics, charts, exports)
- Real-time events (board updates, presence, notifications)

### Contract Test Generation
One test file per endpoint group:
- tests/contract/boards.test.js
- tests/contract/cards.test.js
- tests/contract/columns.test.js
- tests/contract/time.test.js
- tests/contract/analytics.test.js

### Integration Test Scenarios
From user stories:
- Complete board workflow test
- Drag-and-drop card movement test
- Time tracking session test
- Real-time collaboration test
- Analytics generation test

### Quickstart Validation
Creating quickstart.md with:
- Local development setup
- Test data seeding
- Feature validation checklist
- Performance benchmarks

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate ~120 tasks covering all requirements
- Prioritize fixing broken board display (critical path)
- Group by feature area with clear dependencies
- Each feature gets full test coverage before implementation

**Ordering Strategy**:
1. Fix critical issues (board display) [T001-T010]
2. Contract tests for all endpoints [T011-T030]
3. Board/Card core functionality [T031-T050]
4. Time tracking implementation [T051-T070]
5. Analytics and reporting [T071-T090]
6. Organization features [T091-T110]
7. Polish and optimization [T111-T120]

**Parallelization**:
- [P] marks for independent tasks
- Component development parallel to API
- Test writing parallel across features

**Estimated Output**: 120 numbered tasks covering all 25 functional requirements

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*
