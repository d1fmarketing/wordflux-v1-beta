# Feature Specification: HTTPS and Authentication Security

## Overview
Implement HTTPS encryption via Cloudflare Tunnel and add basic authentication to secure the WordFlux application currently running on http://52.4.68.118

## Problem Statement
The application is currently exposed over unencrypted HTTP with no authentication, creating critical security vulnerabilities:
- All data including API keys transmitted in plain text
- No user authentication - anyone can access and modify tasks
- OpenAI API key potentially exposed in network requests
- No protection against unauthorized access or data tampering

## Proposed Solution
Deploy Cloudflare Tunnel for instant HTTPS encryption and implement JWT-based authentication to protect all API endpoints and user sessions.

## Technical Requirements
### Must Have
- HTTPS encryption for all traffic via Cloudflare Tunnel
- JWT-based authentication with secure token storage
- Protected API endpoints (/api/chat, /api/board/*)
- Login page with username/password authentication
- Session management with automatic token refresh
- Secure storage of authentication credentials

### Nice to Have
- OAuth integration (Google/GitHub)
- Rate limiting per authenticated user
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Audit logging for security events

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Cloudflare Tunnel Setup
- Install cloudflared on the EC2 instance
- Configure tunnel to expose port 3000
- Obtain public HTTPS URL from Cloudflare
- Update Nginx configuration for tunnel
- Test HTTPS connectivity and SSL certificate

### Phase 2: Authentication System
- Install NextAuth.js or jsonwebtoken package
- Create login page at /login route
- Implement JWT token generation and validation
- Add authentication middleware to protect API routes
- Create user session management system

### Phase 3: Security Hardening
- Move sensitive configs to environment variables
- Implement CORS policies
- Add request validation and sanitization
- Set up rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Configure security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

## Testing Strategy
- Test HTTPS redirect and SSL certificate validation
- Verify JWT token generation and expiration
- Test protected endpoint access without authentication
- Validate session persistence across page refreshes
- Security penetration testing with OWASP tools

## Success Criteria
- All traffic encrypted with valid SSL certificate
- 100% of API endpoints require authentication
- Zero plaintext transmission of sensitive data
- Login/logout functionality working correctly
- No unauthorized access to protected resources

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours (Cloudflare Tunnel setup)
- Phase 2: 4-6 hours (Authentication implementation)
- Phase 3: 2-3 hours (Security hardening)

## Dependencies
- Cloudflare account (free tier sufficient)
- Access to EC2 instance for cloudflared installation
- Node.js packages: NextAuth.js or jsonwebtoken
- Environment variable configuration

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Cloudflare tunnel connection instability
  - **Mitigation**: Configure automatic restart and health monitoring
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality with auth middleware
  - **Mitigation**: Implement gradual rollout with feature flags
- **Risk**: User lockout due to authentication issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement bypass mechanism for emergency access

## Documentation
- Update README.md with HTTPS URL and authentication setup
- Create AUTHENTICATION.md with detailed auth flow documentation
- Update DEPLOYMENT_PRODUCTION.md with Cloudflare configuration
- Add security best practices to SECURITY.md
